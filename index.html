   <p>Hello! I am Melannie and I am a college student currently working towards
   an AA in Computer Science. I describe myself as creative with an "out there" style.
   A tasteful flashiness is my cue and I attribute it to the influence of my beloved & 
   glamorous Southern Californian roots. This is probably why I see myself as a web developer or
   a web graphics designer in the near future. When I am not at school I am working at Disneyland
   as a part-time custodian and I love my job!</p>
   
   <h1>When I have free time I...</h1>
   <ol>
      <li>cosplay some of my favorite characters (from books, movies or games) & create some unique makeup looks</li>
      <li>read science fiction novels</li>
      <li>spend time with my grandma!</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>My favorite website is specifically my <a href="https://boobonicchronic.tumblr.com/"><i>Tumblr</i></a> because it displays perfectly who I am.</p>
