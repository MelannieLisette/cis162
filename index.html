      <p>Hello! I am Melannie and I am a college student currently working towards
      an AA in Computer Science. I describe myself as creative with an "out there" style.
      A tasteful flashiness is my cue and I attribute it to the influence of my beloved & 
      glamorous Southern Californian roots. This is probably why I see myself as a web developer or
      a web graphics designer in the near future. When I am not at school I am working at Disneyland
      as a part-time custodian and I love my job!</p>
   
      <h2>When I have free time I...</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>cosplay some of my favorite characters (from books, movies or video games) & create some unique makeup looks</li>
         <li>read science fiction novels</li>
         <li>spend time with my grandma!</li>
      </ol>
   
      <p>My favorite website is specifically my <a href="https://boobonicchronic.tumblr.com/"><i>Tumblr</i></a> because it displays perfectly who I am.</p>
